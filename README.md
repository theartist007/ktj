KTJ Summer Training Project (Task 1)

AIM: To create a 2-page website for login and sign up to the KTJ forum.

1. The first page consists of the login page. If you click on the Login Page, a dialog box pops up, asking for your Username and Password.
2. If you click on the Signup button, a form appears where you need to fill up your personal details and Submit.

Note: The page is just a frontend demonstration. The backend part will be added shortly.
